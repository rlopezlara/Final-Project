                        Blockbuster Video is an American best video streaming platform. It was founded by David Cook in
                        1985 as a stand-alone mom-and-pop home video streaming service, but later grew into a national
                        store chain featuring video game rentals, DVD-by-mail, streaming, video on demand, and cinema
                        theater. The company expanded internationally throughout the 1990s. At its peak in 2004,
                        Blockbuster consisted of 9,094 stores and employed approximately 84,300 people: 58,500 in the
                        United States and 25,800 in other countries.
